This repo contains the code for the presentation of LSTM. LSTM is a type of RNN that is able to remember information for a long period of time. It is able to do so by using gates. The gates are used to decide what information to throw away and what information to remember. The gates are controlled by a sigmoid neural network which outputs a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means "completely forget" and 1 means "completely remember". The sigmoid is used to make sure that the gates are either completely open or completely closed. The gates are used to control the flow of information. The gates are:
